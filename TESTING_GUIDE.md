# Testing Your Enhanced LINE Chatbot

## Test Cases for Multi-Message and Quote Functionality

### Test Case 1: Rapid Fire Messages
Send these messages quickly in succession (within 5 seconds):

```
Message 1: "How are you today?"
Message 2: "Do you like sushi?"
Message 3: "Can you teach me how to make it?"
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Loading animation appears for each message
- Bot responds to each question individually
- All three questions get answered
- Conversation history is preserved

**What Changed:**
- ✅ **Before**: Only first message processed, others ignored
- ✅ **After**: All messages processed sequentially

### Test Case 2: Quote Message Testing
1. First, send a normal message: `"What's your favorite food?"`
2. Wait for bot response
3. Use LINE's quote feature to quote the bot's response
4. Send: `"Can you tell me more about this?"`

**Expected Behavior:**
- Bot recognizes this is a quoted message
- Response includes context: "I see you're asking about my previous response regarding..."
- More detailed explanation provided

**What Changed:**
- ✅ **Before**: No quote support
- ✅ **After**: Context-aware quote responses

### Test Case 3: Mixed Message Types
Send this sequence:
1. Regular message: `"Hello!"`
2. Quote a previous message + new text: `"[Quoted message] Why did you say this?"`
3. Another regular message: `"Also, what's the weather like?"`

**Expected Behavior:**
- Message 1: Regular greeting response
- Message 2: Context-aware response referencing the quoted content
- Message 3: Weather-related response (or explanation that bot can't check weather)

## Monitoring Your Bot

### Success Indicators
- ✅ **All messages get responses** (no ignored messages)
- ✅ **Loading animations appear** for each message
- ✅ **Responses are contextual** and relevant
- ✅ **Quote messages are handled** differently than regular messages

### Troubleshooting

#### If Messages Are Still Ignored
1. Check the "Message Processor" node logs
2. Verify the "Should Process Message" filter is working
3. Ensure all connections are properly configured

#### If Quote Messages Don't Work
1. Verify the webhook contains `quotedMessageId` field
2. Check the "Message Processor" node for quote detection
3. Confirm AI Language Model receives quote context

#### If Loading Animation Fails
1. Check "Start Loading Animation" node for errors
2. Verify LINE API credentials
3. Ensure `ignoreHttpStatusErrors` is set to true

## LINE App Testing Tips

### To Test Rapid Messages:
1. Type all messages in a text editor first
2. Copy and paste them quickly into LINE
3. Or type very fast without waiting for responses

### To Test Quote Messages:
1. Long-press on any message in the chat
2. Select "Reply" or "Quote" (depends on your LINE version)
3. Add your additional text
4. Send the quoted message

### To Test Quote Tokens:
- Check your n8n execution logs to see if `quoteToken` and `quotedMessageId` are being captured correctly

## Expected Improvements

### Before Enhancement:
```
User: "How are you?"          → Bot: "I'm fine, thanks!"
User: "What about sushi?"     → [IGNORED]
User: "Can you cook?"         → [IGNORED]
```

### After Enhancement:
```
User: "How are you?"          → Bot: "I'm fine, thanks!"
User: "What about sushi?"     → Bot: "I love sushi! It's a traditional Japanese dish..."
User: "Can you cook?"         → Bot: "I can't physically cook, but I can help you with recipes..."
```

### Quote Message Example:
```
Bot: "I love helping with recipes!"
User: [Quotes above] "Can you share a sushi recipe?"
Bot: "Since you're interested in my cooking help, here's a simple sushi recipe..."
```

## Performance Notes

- **Processing Time**: Each message is processed individually, so response time may be slightly longer for multiple messages
- **Memory Usage**: Chat memory preserves context across all messages
- **Rate Limiting**: Be aware of LINE API rate limits if users send many messages very quickly

Test these scenarios to confirm your enhanced chatbot is working correctly!
